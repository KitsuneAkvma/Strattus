# Strattus - Weather Web App

<img src="public/svg/logo.svg" alt="app-icon" width="100" height="100">

Strattus is a weather web application designed to provide users with comprehensive weather information. The application utilizes the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com) to retrieve weather data, including current weather conditions, location details, forecast, air quality, and alerts. It also incorporates the [ip-api](https://ip-api.com) to handle geolocation and fetch weather data based on the user's location.

## Key Features

- **Current Weather**: Get up-to-date information on the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and more.
- **Temperature and Speed Units**: Users can customize their preferences for temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and speed units (km/h and mph).
- **Forecast**: Access the hourly forecast for the current day and a 3-day forecast ahead to plan your activities accordingly.
- **Air Quality**: Stay informed about the air quality index, pollution levels, and driving/jogging conditions for a healthier outdoor experience.
- **Location Search**: Search for specific locations and save them for easy access. The saved locations can be managed (added, edited, or deleted) in the dedicated menu.
- **Favorites**: Mark a location as a favorite, and it will be displayed in the drawer on the left side of the screen for quick reference.
- **Dashboard**: View detailed information for saved locations, including current weather, temperature variations, and additional data. (Work in Progress)
- **Appearance**: The app's appearance adapts to the time of day, providing a visually pleasing experience.
- **Mobile and Desktop Support**: In the future, the app will be developed using React Native for mobile devices and Electron for desktop applications.
